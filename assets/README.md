# Assets

This directory contains all the game assets including sprites, sounds, fonts, and models.

## Subdirectories

- **sprites/** - 2D images, textures, spritesheets
- **sounds/** - Audio files (music, sound effects)
- **fonts/** - Font files (.ttf, .otf)
- **models/** - 3D models and related files

## Best Practices

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize assets by type and purpose
- Keep original/source files in a separate location
- Use appropriate file formats (PNG for sprites, OGG for sounds)
- Consider resolution and file size optimization
