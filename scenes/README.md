# Scenes

This directory contains all the scene files (.tscn) for the game.

## Organization

- Main game scenes (e.g., MainMenu, GameLevel, etc.)
- UI scenes (e.g., HUD, PauseMenu, etc.)
- Prefab/reusable scenes (e.g., Player, Enemy, Gem, etc.)

## Best Practices

- Keep scene files organized by type or game area
- Use descriptive names for scenes
- Consider creating subdirectories for complex projects (e.g., scenes/levels/, scenes/ui/)
