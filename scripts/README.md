# Scripts

This directory contains all the script files for the game.

## Organization

- GDScript files (.gd)
- C# scripts (.cs) - for Godot Mono projects
- Autoload/singleton scripts
- Game logic scripts
- UI controller scripts

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive names for scripts
- One class per file
- Follow naming conventions (PascalCase for C#, snake_case for GDScript)
- Keep scripts focused and single-purpose
- Consider creating subdirectories for better organization (e.g., scripts/player/, scripts/enemies/)
